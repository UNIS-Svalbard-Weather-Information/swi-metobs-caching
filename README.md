## Overview
The Svalbard Weather Information (SWI) project is a web application designed to assist users in planning trips to Svalbard. It provides essential tools and near real-time weather data from various weather stations in the region. The application includes map layers, avalanche forecasts, sea ice information, regulation layers, and more.

## Features
- **Map Layers**: Visualize different geographical and environmental data layers, including avalanche forecasts, sea ice information, and regulation layers.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Access near real-time weather information from multiple weather stations.
- **GPX Import/Export**: Easily import and export GPX files for route planning and sharing.
- **Drawing Tools**: Annotate and draw on maps to customize your trip planning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile` file.


### Build

If you want to test the latest developments that are not yet released, you need to build the app from scratch:

1. Clone the repository and go to the wanted branch:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LouisPauchet/UNIS_SvalbardWeatherInformation.git
   cd UNIS_SvalbardWeatherInformation
   git checkout [name of the branch to test]
   ```

2. Build the container:

   ```sh
   docker build -t swi-server .
   ```

3. Update the docker-compose file to replace the image name from Docker Hub with the name `swi-server`:

   ```sh
   sed -i 's|lpauchet/swi-server:latest|swi-server|g' docker-compose.yml
   ```

4. If you need to work with the config files, you can add this line in the swi-server container in the Docker compose file
   ```plaintext
   - ./static/config:/app/static/config
   ```
### Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
2. Add your API keys for the different data sources to the `.env` file. For example:
   ```plaintext
   SWI_FROST_API_KEY=your_frost_api_key
   SWI_IWIN_FIXED_API_KEY=your_iwin_api_key
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Start the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost`. For the default docker file, there is one caching service and two worker behind a caddy load balancer.

### Production Environment
For production use, it is recommended to set up a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the `swi_serve` service. This ensures high availability and reliability. Additionally, consider implementing monitoring and logging to track the application's performance and quickly address any issues that may arise. Note that access logs should be implemented at the load balancer level.

For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the [Deployment Documentation](https://swi-svalbard-weather-information.readthedocs.io/latest/admin/deployment/).

## Automated Workflows
- **Auto Test**: Automated tests are set up to ensure the application runs smoothly.
- **Release**: Automated release workflows are configured for seamless deployment.
- **Build**: Automated build processes are in place to compile the application efficiently.
